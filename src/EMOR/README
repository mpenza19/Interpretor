This package contains an English finite state morphology which is based
on the XTag morphology available from the University of Pennsylvania.

In order to run the tools, you first have to install the SFST tools.

Then you can compile the morphology by running the command "make".

Finally, you can test it:

> fst-mor emor.a



To run the morphology in batch mode use:
> echo "walking" | fst-infl2 emor.ca


You can modify the morphology by adapting the file xtag-morph-1.5a.gz
and running "make" again.
