The blessed virgin Mary and Saint Joseph are two of the greatest among the communion of saints. Although both these members of the holy family are great, Mary however is greater than Joseph, for she is the greatest of all the saints and of all creatures. To Mary is a singular honor: she is the Mother of God, called the immaculate conception. But Joseph, who is not called the father of Jesus but his guardian, has not received this extraordinary grace. Because of the graces which are to them: that is, Joseph's grace from raising the Son of God and Mary's grace as mother of God:Â Joseph deserves our veneration, and Mary our greater veneration. But worship or adoration belongs to God alone.
